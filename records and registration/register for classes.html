<h2>Student Planning:</h2>
<p>The Student Planning module can be accessed in WebAdvisor under the Academic Profile section. Student Planning is a tool that gives you the ability to plan your courses for your entire Champlain College career, to review your plans with your Faculty Advisor and have them approved, and to register for your courses. It can also be used to plan courses in a weekly schedule format.</p>
<p>If you are considering changing your major, you may "view a new major" and see the degree requirements for the program you are interested in. Your&nbsp;<a href="https://www.champlain.edu/current-students/academic-information/registrars-office/meet-our-staff">Academic Specialist</a>&nbsp;in the Registrar's Office is available to review the Student Planning module with you and answer any questions you have.</p>
<h2>To Access Student Planning:</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Log in to WebAdvisor from https://www.champlain.edu/current-students</li>
    <li>In WebAdvisor, select the Student menu, then click on the Student Planning link, which is on the bottom left under the Academic Profile section</li>
</ol>
<h3 align="left">To Review and Change Your Student Plan:</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Click on "View Your Progress."</li>
    <li>First-year students will have courses planned for them in Student Planning; you can view them either by scrolling down the page or by clicking on the Plan &amp; Schedule tab and clicking on the Timeline tab.</li>
    <li>You can remove courses from your plan by clicking on the "x" next to the course on your timeline.</li>
    <li>You can also view the course description and change the term that you plan to take it by clicking on the course in the timeline.</li>
    <li>You can add courses to your plan in two ways:
        <ul>
            <li>First, by going to the "My Progress" tab. Scroll down in your program until you see the course you want to plan.
                <ul>
                    <li>Click on the Course Number&mdash;this will take you to the Student Planning catalog for that course.</li>
                    <li>Click the "Add Course to Plan" button.</li>
                    <li>Select the term in which you want to take the course (e.g. 2018 Fall Semester, 2019 Spring Semester) and click the "Add Course to Plan" button again. Note: Do not use terms other than the Fall Semester and Spring Semester options. The other terms listed are for the Online Continuing Professional Studies and Graduate level students. Do not plan a course in the summer without discussing it with your Faculty Advisor or Academic Specialist.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>The second way to add courses to your plan is to go directly to the "Course Catalog" tab. Here you can search for specific subject codes or click on one in the list. Only select 3-letter subject codes; the 4-letter codes are for students in the Continuing Professional Studies programs (i.e. choose the ACC code for Accounting courses,&nbsp;<em>not&nbsp;</em>the ACCT courses).
                <ul>
                    <li>Click on the subject code you are looking for, then you can filter your choices and add courses to your plan.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Please Remember:&nbsp;Once you have planned your courses, you may need to have your plan approved by your Faculty Advisor in order to register. You will want to meet with them as soon as possible to go over your choices, so that you will have no issues registering when your registration window opens.</li>
</ol>
<h3>To Choose and Register for Sections:</h3>
<ol>
    <li>To choose the specific sections of your courses that you would like to register for, go to the "Plan &amp; Schedule" tab and make sure that you are looking at the upcoming term (e.g. for Spring 2017 registration, make sure that you are looking at the 2017 Spring Semester calendar).</li>
    <li>On the left, the courses that you have planned will be listed. Click on "View Other Sections" to see your section choices for the term.&nbsp;</li>
    <li>Click on the section that you want to add to your schedule. If you are certain that this is the course that you want, click "Add Section to Schedule." It will now show as planned on the left.</li>
    <li>Once you have planned your sections and your Registration Window has opened, you are ready to Register. You can attempt to register for all of your courses at the same time by clicking on the "Register Now" button, or individually by clicking on the "Register" button on each course.</li>
</ol>
<h2>To Access Student Planning as a Faculty Advisor:</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Log in to WebAdvisor and go to the Faculty menu.</li>
    <li>From the Faculty Information menu on the left, select "Student Planning."</li>
    <li>You will be taken to a new window that is Student Planning. Click on the "Advising" tab along the top.</li>
    <li>The service will automatically pull up the list of all your advisees, and you can use the search box to pull up the record of a specific student.</li>
